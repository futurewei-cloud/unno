# Introduction

Unno is an AI-enabled video annotation platform to help users annotating videos automatically. Nowaday, the massasive adoption of AI technologies relies on the availbility of big data, computing power, and deep learning algorithms. It has become a routine to start a project by collecting a large amount of high quality labeled data, and build a deep learning model with GPU computing. However, it is very time-consuming and costly to collect large amount of high quality labeled data. When it comes to collecting high quality labeled video data, it becomes even harder.  This motivates us to start this project to help users annotating videos automatically by including human in the loop.
