An AI-enabled video annotation platform.

## Introduction
Nowadays,Â the massive adoption of AI technologies relies on the availability of big data, computing power, and deep learning algorithms. It has become a routine to pipeline a project by collecting a large amount of high quality labeled data, and build a deep learning model with GPU computing. However, it is very time-consuming and costly to collect large amounts of high quality labeled data. When it comes to collecting high quality labeled _video_ data, it becomes even harder. This motivates us to start this project to help users annotating videos automatically by including human in the loop.
