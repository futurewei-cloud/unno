## Contributing

### Contributor Workflow

Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. This is usually master.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push changes in a topic branch to a personal fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to [unno](https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/unno).
- The PR must receive approvals from two team members including at least one maintainer.


### Coding Style

We are following the PEP8 style, which can be automatically formatted using the tool [here](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8)

### Documentation and Design Documents

We rely on [Mizar's Github wiki](https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/unno/wiki) for documentation.  Being a git repository ensures that documents and designs are reviewed and facilitate onboarding.

To update the documentation/design, clone the wiki locally https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/unno.wiki.git, and create a pull request for your changes and send it to the team for review.

### Versioning

We follow the following versioning structure:
Major.Minor-#.  Stable releases versions must have an even Minor number.

### Issue tracking and filing a bug

We use the included GitHub issues to track progress, scope, priority, and assignment of milestones and software changes.

We love feedback! If you would like to help us improve or wants to file a bug, please create an issue.
